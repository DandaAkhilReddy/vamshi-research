            <h3>1.1 Technology and Platform Capabilities</h3>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <h4>Mobile LiDAR Performance Characteristics</h4>
                <p>
                    Mobile LiDAR systems integrated with GPS and IMU hardware can scan approximately <span class="stat">10 km of beach and cliff</span>
                    with high spatial resolution (~1000 pts/m²) in just a few hours. UAV LiDAR systems achieve vertical accuracy of
                    approximately <span class="stat">5 cm</span>, while ground-based mobile systems demonstrate <span class="stat">±2 cm accuracy at 25 m</span>
                    collecting about <span class="stat">700,000 points per second</span>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The Coastal Processes Group uses LiDAR scanners mounted on trucks, drones, all-terrain vehicles, buildings,
                and towers to measure waves, beach erosion, and cliff erosion. This multi-platform approach enables
                comprehensive coastal monitoring across different scales and environments.
            </p>

            <h3>1.2 Accuracy Assessment at Padre Island</h3>

            <div class="citation">
                USGS Accuracy Assessment Study (Padre Island National Seashore): Final point cloud accuracy of
                <strong>0.060 m (east), 0.095 m (north), and 0.053 m (height)</strong>. Mobile terrestrial LiDAR proven
                useful for mapping complex features like dunes and monitoring geomorphic changes.
            </div>

            <p>
                A recent Hurricane Hanna impact assessment study (2020) utilized a Velodyne mobile LiDAR system integrated
                with a 360-degree spherical camera along North Padre Island beach. This rapid assessment approach detected
                elevation change following the storm, demonstrating the value of mobile systems for emergency response and
                post-disaster monitoring.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 Monitoring Applications</h3>

            <p>Studies of LiDAR in coastal areas have expanded to include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Topographic mapping</strong> of beaches with millimetric precision</li>
                <li><strong>Assessment of vegetation canopies</strong> in coastal dune systems</li>
                <li><strong>Assessment of coral reefs</strong> using topobathymetric systems</li>
                <li><strong>Assessment of landslides and subsidence</strong> in coastal bluffs</li>
                <li><strong>Study of geomorphic changes</strong> caused by storms and sedimentation</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <h4>Latest Development (2025)</h4>
                <p>
                    A fusion system combining 3D LiDAR with video cameras, capable of simultaneously capturing 3D coordinates
                    and surface colors of beaches and nearshore waves, was tested at two coastal sites in Japan. This system
                    enables minutely monitoring of swash zone processes, demonstrating high potential for fine-scale coastal
                    dynamics research.

            <h3>2.1 Padre Island Kemp's Ridley Study (2020)</h3>

            <div class="citation">
                <strong>Key Study:</strong> Figlus et al. (2020), "Using Lidar Data to Assess the Relationship Between Beach
                Geomorphology and Kemp's Ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) Nest Site Selection Along Padre Island, TX, United States."
                <em>Frontiers in Marine Science</em>, 7:214.
            </div>

            <div class="key-finding">
                <h4>Major Findings for Kemp's Ridley at PAIS</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Beach geomorphology characteristics (width and slope) were extracted from LiDAR-derived digital elevation models and successfully associated with Kemp's nest coordinates</li>
                    <li>Most important variables in nest presence models: <strong>elevation, distance from shoreline, maximum dune slope, and average beach slope</strong></li>
                    <li>Study successfully modeled Kemp's ridley nest presence using beach geomorphology characteristics alone</li>
                    <li>Demonstrated that LiDAR-derived metrics can predict nesting habitat suitability without requiring biological surveys</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                This research provides the direct precedent for using MLS data to analyze Kemp's ridley habitat at PAIS.
                However, the 2020 study used single-date LiDAR data. The opportunity exists to build on this work with
                multi-temporal MLS datasets to examine temporal stability and change.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Mississippi Barrier Islands Assessment</h3>

            <p>
                A USGS project identified potential sea turtle nesting habitat on Cat and Ship Islands using digital elevation
                models developed from LiDAR data and dune toes from LiDAR-derived beach morphology. While focused on different
                species, this study demonstrates methodology for habitat potential mapping that could be adapted for Kemp's ridley.

            <div class="key-finding">
                <h4>2023-2024 Nesting Activity at PAIS</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>More Kemp's ridley nests are found at PAIS than any other location in the U.S.</li>
                    <li><strong>Record year (2017):</strong> 353 nests documented at PAIS</li>
                    <li><strong>2024 first nest:</strong> Mid-April discovery with 81 eggs</li>

            <h2 id="section3">3. Multi-Temporal LiDAR Erosion Mapping and Change Detection</h2>

            <h3>3.1 DEMs of Difference (DoD) Methodology</h3>

            <p>
                The standard approach for multi-temporal LiDAR analysis involves computing <span class="highlight">DEMs of Difference (DoD)</span>,
                resulting in segregated maps of erosion and deposition and sediment budgets. To account for LiDAR dataset accuracy,
                a probabilistic approach at a <span class="stat">95% confidence interval</span> is used as a threshold for Geomorphic
                Change Detection, showing more reliable results than simple differencing.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Volume Change Analysis</h3>

            <p>
                LiDAR-based digital elevation models are widely used for quantification of beach and dune volume change, particularly
                for studying storm impacts. Four LiDAR datasets from Ship Island, Mississippi (2004, 2007, 2010, 2012) capturing
                complete topography revealed erosional/depositional patterns and geomorphologic changes, investigating sediment
                volume changes at depths up to 8 m.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 French Coast Multi-Temporal Study (5-Year Series)</h3>

            <div class="citation">
                <strong>Benchmark Study:</strong> Three beach and dune systems in the Bay of Biscay, France, monitored over
                5 years with three airborne LiDAR datasets. Reproducible monitoring solutions adapted to basic and complex
                beach and dune morphologies were investigated.

                <ul>
                    <li>Developed shoreline mobility indicators combining horizontal and vertical migrations of the dune base</li>
                    <li>Created reproducible workflows for simple and complex beach morphologies</li>
                    <li>Demonstrated importance of multi-period analysis (not just two-date comparisons)</li>

            <h3>3.4 Advanced 4D Geospatial Analysis</h3>

            <p>
                Recent developments (2019-2024) in spatiotemporal segmentation enable <span class="highlight">4D objects-by-change</span>
                analysis from LiDAR time series. Geographic observation benefits from increasing availability of 3D geospatial
                data time series, allowing analysis of change processes at high temporal detail over extensive periods.

                <h4>Machine Learning for Shoreline Change (2024-2025)</h4>
                <p>
                    Machine learning techniques integrated with remote sensing and GIS improve predictive accuracy of shoreline
                    change models, with <span class="stat">Random Forest classifiers achieving ~90% accuracy</span> for detecting
                    coastal degradation zones when applied to LiDAR and orthophoto data. Algorithms analyze historical shoreline

            <p>
                A 2016 study demonstrated that marine turtles are "not fussy nesters" when examined at small spatial scales,
                but geomorphology (elevation, slope), temperature, humidity, hydrodynamics, and human activity all influence
                nesting suitability at larger scales. Specific nest placement in terms of distance from high water line,
                vegetation, slope, and elevation varies by species and location.

                LiDAR terrain data characterization of surface roughness and microtopography has advanced significantly.
                A 2019 method for estimating multiscale surface roughness based on standard deviation of surface normals
                utilizes scale partitioning and integral image processing. As fine-resolution LiDAR DEMs become increasingly
                common, multiscale analysis has potential for improving mapping and classification applications.
